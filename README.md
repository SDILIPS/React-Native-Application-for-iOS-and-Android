## Create a React Native App and Run it on the iOS Simulator and Android Emulator

The name of the app is `RestaurantReview`. Note that the app name must be alphanumeric only and can't contain spaces. You can also change this name later before you distribute the app.

```
$ react-native init RestaurantReview
```
